```
virtualenv -p python3.6 .venv_name
```

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/klaudiaplk/pszt_neural_network.git
cd pszt_neural_network
pip install .
```

# Usage
We can run the script using the command:
```
neural_network [--file-path FILE_PATH]
```
Parameterthat is optional to run the neural network:
```
--file-path -> [str] Path to the file containing training and testing data.
